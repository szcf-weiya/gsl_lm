# gsl_lm

Implement regression in C++ by using gsl.

Firstly, I implement these regression on the dataset in particular R package by using R program. You can see more details about these datasets by clicking the following links.

- [Ordinary Least Squares Regression](ols/rlm.nb.html)
- [Logistic Regression](logit/rlogit.nb.html)
- [Poisson Regression](poisson/rpoisson.nb.html)

Then, I will show the regression fit results by using C++ program.
